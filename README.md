# Leaf Doctor: Automated Plant Disease Identification using CNN and Transfer Learning

About Project (Summary): 
An interface that can diagnose diseases in leaves (in real-time) using Convolutional Neural Networks.  The dataset used contains 38 classes of 14 species of plants with healthy and diseased leaf images (captured in laboratory conditions).  An EffiecientNetB0-based model has been used along with additional layers for disease-specific feature extractions.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
CNNÂ is a Deep Learning algorithm which takes in an input image, assigns importance to different aspects of the image and is able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a convolutional neural network is significantly lower when compared to other different algorithms used for classification.

About the Dataset
This project uses the standard open-access PlantVillage dataset, which consists of 54,305 numbers of healthy- and infected-plant leaves. This database contains 38 classes of 14 species of plants with healthy and diseased leaf images. All images are captured in laboratory conditions. All leaf images are divided into two sets, a training set and the testing set.
